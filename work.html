            <h2>My Passion</h2>
            <div class="featured-section">
                <p>I'm passionate about creating technology that makes a difference. I believe in building tools that are not only functional but also beautiful and intuitive. Every project I work on is an opportunity to learn something new and push the boundaries of what's possible.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">All my projects are allways based on problems I find in real life. I love finding ways to fix something, or make it easier. Every line of code isnt just a fun bit of programming, it's learning how to problem solve, to think outside the box, and bring ideas to life.</p>

        <!-- Journey & Background -->
        <section id="journey">
            <h2>How I Got Started</h2>
            <div class="featured-section">
                <h3>The Beginning</h3>
                <p>My journey began when I was 10 years old, within school, the projects we were learning all had to do with programming. <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" class="inline-link" target="_blank">Scratch</a> to be exact. I found this passion on the app. I even brought my excitment home, and worked on stuff there. Eventually getting a laptop, and making games on the offical website.</p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">The Turning Point</h3>
                <p>At this point, I was always coming up with game ideas, projects, and more. But the website was limiting— after all it was made for kids. So I eventually decided to start working on my code outside, I started with the popular game at the time, <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/" class="inline-link" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>. A system to make datapacks was available in the game, this taught me the file management, syntax and thoughts I needed to code.<p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Today</h3>
                <p>Now, to this day I'm learning new languages, ways of thinking, and even teaching others what ive learned. Evvery step I've made has been put into a great deal of where I am today. Working with, now friends, to create experiences that everyone loves. I, myself, am happy with where it's gotten me..</p>
